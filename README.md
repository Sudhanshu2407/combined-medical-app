Here we combine three different disease problems.These disease are parkinson detection,cardic arrest prediction,diabetes prediction and the frontend is created using streamlit.

# Health Condition Prediction App

Welcome to the Health Condition Prediction App repository! This project is a comprehensive web application that integrates machine learning models to 

predict Diabetes, Heart Attack Death Risk, and Parkinson's Disease. The goal is to provide early warnings and personalized health management advice to 

improve patient outcomes.


# Project Overview

This app brings together three critical health prediction models into one user-friendly interface:

Diabetes Prediction: Utilizes patient data to predict the likelihood of diabetes, enabling proactive health management.

Heart Attack Death Prediction: Assesses the risk of death due to heart attacks, offering insights for timely medical intervention.

Parkinson's Disease Detection: Detects the presence of Parkinson's Disease by analyzing voice and other medical parameters, aiding in early diagnosis 

and management.

# Objectives

Early Detection: Facilitate timely medical advice and treatment through early detection of critical health conditions.

Personalized Health Management: Provide tailored health tips based on prediction results.

AI in Healthcare: Demonstrate the potential of AI and machine learning in enhancing healthcare services.

# Advantages

User-Friendly: The app, built with Streamlit, ensures easy interaction and instant predictions.

Early Intervention: Enables individuals to seek timely medical advice and treatment.

Health Tips: Offers personalized tips to manage and prevent health conditions.

# Future Goals
